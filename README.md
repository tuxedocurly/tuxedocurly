I'm a maker with a passion for code, electronics, and prototyping. Check out my build guides and project videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TuxedoMakes).

My projects are a labor of love, built during my spare time. If you'd like to support me, consider checking out [my shop](https://ko-fi.com/tuxedomakes/shop) where I sell PCBs/parts to make my projects, fully assembed keyboards, and take commissions!

**Your support helps me:**

*   Dedicate more time to improve and support my designs.
*   Experiment with new features and ideas.
*   Kickstart other open-source projects that you might love.

Even a small coffee-sized contribution goes a long way, and if you use the shop you'll get a useful part for your next project - plus my eternal gratitude!

**Happy building!**
