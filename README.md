My projects are a labor of love, built during my spare time. If you've found this keyboard design helpful, interesting, or just plain awesome, consider checking out [my shop](https://buymeacoffee.com/tuxedomakes/extras) where I sell PCBs and parts to make my projects, or buy me a coffee!

**Your support helps me:**

*   Dedicate more time to improve this design.
*   Experiment with new features and ideas.
*   Kickstart other open-source projects that you might love.

Even a small coffee-sized contribution goes a long way in fueling my passion for open source. If you use the shop, you'll get a useful part for your next project, plus my eternal gratitude!

**Thank you for being awesome!**
